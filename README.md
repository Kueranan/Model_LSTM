# Model_LSTM
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture that is specifically designed to capture long-range dependencies and patterns in sequential data. LSTMs are widely used in various fields, including natural language processing, time series analysis, and speech recognition, due to their ability to handle sequences of data and effectively learn temporal relationships.

The key feature of LSTM networks is their ability to maintain and update memory over long sequences, addressing the vanishing gradient problem that can occur in traditional RNNs. LSTMs achieve this through a combination of three gating mechanisms: the input gate, the forget gate, and the output gate.
